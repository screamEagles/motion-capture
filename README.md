# How to use the motion capture?
<b>Step 1:</b> Open the Python folder, and edit this line of code to your liking:
`cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)`<br />
Either enter a number that represents the webcam you are using or enter the video's name (or file path) as a string.

<b>Step 2:</b> When the video or the webcam plays, the program will start noting down the coordinates, but they will not be recorded in a .txt file. Pressing the "s" key will save those coordinates and stop the program. After that, you will get a file named "AnimationFile.txt"

<b>Step 3:</b> Upload the file in the Unity project's Assets folder, and run the game to see the output.
